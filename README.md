# JPA C.R.U.D Project
## Overview
This project was to a be a full stack C.R.U.D program similar to last weeks. The key differences from this weeks project to last weeks being the addition of the Java Persistence API and that we created our own database. Additionally we were given technology to do execute queries in a simpler manner with JPQL. This weeks home work was all about doing the same thing as last week but in a more elegant and readable manner.


### New/Key Concepts
* Java Persistence API
* JPQL
* MySQL Workbench
* Creating EER diagrams
* Creating databases from EER diagrams
* Transactional CRUD with JPA

### Lessons learned
This project further increased my confidence as a programmer as things keep going smoother and smoother. I saw first hand this weekend the value of learning things the more complicated way first. The simplicity of JPA would have taken away from my understanding of how all the pieces and parts of a spring boot app work together if we had learned that first. This weekend also offered me further confidence as I had a family emergency strike and I was still able to push through and make a minimum viable product that looked and functioned better then I could have hoped for considering the circumstance. Furthermore, I enjoyed the Database architect aspect of this project and once we learn more (and get some free time) I would like to put my whole library in a database and build a personal app with the same functions. This project also taught me the value of planning your steps when building a program. Stepping through your process methodically, meticulously, and most of all one piece at a time vs building multiple parts in one push saves you time debugging later on and improves the overall design of your product.

### How to Run
To use this application direct your Browser to localhost 8082 and start the server within your IDE. This app will eventually be deployed to AWS but is not for now.

Once in the home page a list of all the books in the database are displayed and may be clicked on to display their information. Additionally a book may be searched for by its id with the form at the top of the page. If the user would like to add a book to the database simply click the link below the search form. lastly the user has the option of updating or deleting a book once its info is displayed. if the user wants to delete a book it will be asked to confirm that this is actually the desired operation.
